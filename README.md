Summary:

62+% increase in performance for large file systems

# Usage
1. To generate expected hashes (first time setup)
```
anticheat-dev <game_directory> -g
```

Remember to drag in verification.txt file (generated by the tool) into your game directory,
and ship with the verification.txt file

2. To verify files
```
anticheat-dev <game_directory> -v
```
Will exit with signal
0 - Verification Success
3 - Unsuccessful (Tampered files)

# Build instructions
In project root run:
```
make
```
To build the tool.

# Running Benchmarks
To run timing benchmarks (For Multithreaded version only):
```
./timeBenchmark -setup
```
(Run above command first time only, requires around 100mb of space)

```
./timeBenchmark -g
```
(Simply generates the expected hashes, performance wasn't considered at this step, so no multithreading)

```
./timeBenchmark -v
```
